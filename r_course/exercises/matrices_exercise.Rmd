These exercises cover the sections of Statistics in R [Introduction to R](https://lmsbioinformatics.github.io/LMS_Reproducible-R/r_course/introToR_Session1.html).

**Exercise 1**

- Create a matrix containing information on gene names Gene_1, Gene_2, Gene_3,Gene_4 expression values 1000, 3000, 10000, 12000 and gene lengths 100, 3000, 200, 1000

- Update the matrix to contain the expression over the gene length for all genes (Length normalised expression - LNE) as final column.

HINT - We calculated LNE before in [vectors exercises' bonus question](../answers/vector_answers.html#bonus)

- Create a smaller matrix containing genes longer than 200

- Create a smaller matrix with just expression and LNE columns containing genes longer than 200 and expression greater than 300

**Bonus Question**
<a name="bonus"></a>
- Calculate the sum of expression and length columns for only genes with length > 100.
